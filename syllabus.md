## Welcome to Ideation &amp; Prototyping!

In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research &amp; thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

*   develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
*   develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
*   develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
*   develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### COURSE GOALS

To get students to:

*   develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas
*   use their imagination to create something entirely new &amp; innovative OR to reinvent an old idea into something new
*   introduce students to the many research &amp; design methodologies available to them
*   develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical thinking.
*   improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
*   facilitate collaboration


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this course students should be able to:

*   to search and spot ideas, and transform these invisible ideas into visible realizations


### COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will be comprised of lectures, critiques, discussions, readings, screenings, exercises, projects, and a collaborative research paper.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. The class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the impact of your project. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your critique notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand what you are doing to make your project better. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

There will be discrete team and individual exercises and projects that require you to apply the tools, techniques, and methods presented in the lectures, discussions, readings, and other material. These fundamentals are organized according to five phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration**

*   Seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, feeling
*   Collecting, obsessing, hoarding

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration: Steal Like An Artist**

*   Reappropriating, remixing

**Phase 2: Research / Ideation / Brainstorming**

*   Asking and listening
*   Visual researching
*   Materials researching
*   User / audience researching and ethnographic researching
*   Systems researching
*   Activity researching
*   Primary researching
*   Scholarly researching
*   Brainstorming, gamestorming, ideation

**Phase 3: Design / Sketching / Mapping**

*   Visualizing, drawing, sketching
*   Planning and mapping
*   Grouping, clustering, comparing, contrasting
*   Organizing and designing
*   Reorganizing and redesigning
*   Shaping and forming
*   Discerning and revealing
*   Connecting and disconnecting

**Phase 4: Prototyping**

*   Making, building, creating
*   Rapid prototyping
*   Iterating
*   Selecting and editing
*   Breaking then repeating all of the above

**Phase 5: Positioning / Pitching**

*   Framing and positioning
*   Storytelling, engaging, communicating, selling

* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Direct message me on slack re: contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not direct message me long conversations on slack. (if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)

### EVALUATION & GRADING

*   All work assigned will be completed and delivered on the due date, otherwise you will receive a failing grade for that assignment. In other words, late work will not be accepted.
*   Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the due date.
*   Each student will be judged on the application of the ideas and concepts introduced during the course. Incomplete or unsatisfactory work will receive a failing grade.
 
Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative &amp; qualitative rubrics:

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing I&amp;P homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.
